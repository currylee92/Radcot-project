# RadCoT Reasoning Patterns

This document describes the three distinct reasoning patterns that emerge when using the RadCoT framework:

## 1. Cross-sectional Correlation (r=0.91)

Cross-sectional correlation involves systematic comparison of radiological findings across different imaging planes, sequences, and report sections to identify inconsistencies. This pattern shows the highest correlation with performance improvements.

### Characteristics:
- Compares findings between different sections of the report
- Evaluates consistency across multiple imaging planes/sequences
- Identifies contradictions in descriptions of the same structure
- Links related findings across anatomical regions

### Example:
In an abdominal MRI report, cross-sectional correlation might identify that a "2.3 cm lesion in segment VII of the liver" is described as "hyperintense on T2" in the findings section but referred to as "hypointense on T2" in the impression section.

## 2. Sequential Radiological Verification (r=0.72)

Sequential verification involves systematic progression through anatomical structures following standard radiological search patterns and reporting conventions.

### Characteristics:
- Follows a structured anatomical review pattern
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of all report components
- Employs a systematic "checklist" approach
- Preserves contextual relationships between adjacent structures

### Example:
When analyzing a chest CT report, this pattern would verify findings in a systematic order: lungs → heart → mediastinum → pleura → airways → osseous structures, ensuring no regions are overlooked.

## 3. Diagnostic Confidence Assessment (r=0.68)

Diagnostic confidence assessment involves graded certainty evaluation based on imaging quality, finding conspicuity, and differential diagnosis considerations.

### Characteristics:
- Evaluates appropriateness of certainty language
- Assesses whether diagnostic confidence matches imaging evidence
- Identifies inconsistent confidence levels across the report
- Verifies appropriate hedging for equivocal findings

### Example:
This pattern might identify that a report describes a "possibly enlarged lymph node" in the findings section but states "lymphadenopathy is present" with inappropriate certainty in the impression.
