EXAMINATION: CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST
 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Shortness of breath, rule out pulmonary embolism
 
TECHNIQUE: Helical CT images were obtained through the chest without intravenous contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
LUNGS: There is a 2.5 cm nodular opacity in the right lower lobe with spiculated margins. There is a 1.2 cm nodule in the left upper lobe. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No pleural effusions.
 
HEART: The heart is normal in size. The pericardium is unremarkable.
 
MEDIASTINUM: The mediastinal contours are normal. No significant lymphadenopathy.
 
VASCULATURE: The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. No evidence of aneurysm or dissection.
 
PLEURA: No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No acute fractures. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.5 cm spiculated nodule in the left lower lobe, highly suspicious for primary lung malignancy. Recommend PET/CT for further evaluation.
2. 1.2 cm nodule in the left upper lobe, likely granuloma but follow-up recommended.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
